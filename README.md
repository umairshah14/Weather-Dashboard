# Daily Planner

## Description
I created this repository to hold my submission for the week8 challenge which was to create a weather forecast website, when you type in a city, you receive information for the current day forecast as well as the weather forecast for the next five days. If the city is not recognised, then nothing shows up. Every time a city is searched a button is generated on the side as a shortcut to see the weather forecast for that day again.

This task helped me really grasp how to work with 3rd party api's and how to read, extrapolate and display information from them. I combined my knowledge of jquery with my new learnt knowledge on how to work with api's to complete this task

Below is a screenshot of what the project should look like when opened in the browser
